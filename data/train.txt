2 economic spotlight u s deficit with nics the u s trade deficit with taiwan and korea is expected to widen this year despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries economists said the surpluses that taiwan and korea ran with the u s in will get bigger this time next year the u s will be screaming at those countries about their exports said steve cerier of manufacturers hanover trust co taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the u s after japan and canada while korea is the seventh largest faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in congress the reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against taiwan and korea urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade the thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries nics amid signs the dollar s steep drop against the currencies of japan and most ec nations previously the main focus of the u s drive to cut its trade gap is beginning to close the competiveness gap for american goods u s treasury secretary james baker said recently that he expects a reduction in japan s trade surplus this year but u s manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to taiwan and korea whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark as major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs taiwanese and korean exporters are well placed to take up the slack in the fashionable comment in washington was japan bashing now it s nic bashing said robert chandross of lloyds bank plc asia s four main nics hong kong south korea singapore and taiwan accounted for almost one fifth of the overall billion dlr u s merchandise trade deficit for the u s trade gap with taiwan rose to billion dlrs in from billion in while the bilateral trade deficit with south korea grew to billion from billion and preliminary u s data show that the growth trend is continuing the u s trade shortfall with taiwan was billion dlrs in january up pct from a year earlier the gap with korea was mln dlrs up pct from a year ago lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions korea said it is choosing many of the items on which the u s wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation still south korean trade minister rha woong bae said last week that korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its billion dlr foreign debt for its part taiwan said in january that it will cut tariffs on goods sometime in the second half of and try to diversify exports but vice economic minister wang chien shien said last month that he still does not expect taiwan s trade surplus with the u s will fall in the nics have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods but korea is raising its profile in the area of big ticket manufactured goods notably cars korea expects its auto exports mostly for north america to balloon to units in from zero in the nics exports are almost all manufactured goods when their exports rise it hits the heart of the u s manufacturing base it cuts directly to us and to our customers said bob wendt manager for economic studies at bethlehem steel corp the u s takes pct of korea s computer products exports pct of its electrical appliances and pct of its telecommunications equipment a recent study by morgan guaranty trust co says taiwan and south korea are the most pressing trade issue for the u s while hong kong and singapore run trade surpluses with the u s these are offset by their deficits with other countries but taiwan and to a lesser extent south korea stand in marked contrast both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the u s and major overrall trade and current account surpluses the morgan study says morgan expects taiwan s overall trade surplus to grow to billion dlrs in from billion last year and korea s to increase to billion dlrs from billion concern about the nics is not confined to the u s a lot of korea and taiwan s exports to the u s have been at japan s expense said richard koss at general motors corp february s paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted nics to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies but this two pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and in any case will only work with a sizeable lag economists say the u s has not said how much it thinks the taiwan s and korea s currencies should climb the taiwan dollar which is pegged to the u s dollar has risen about pct since september while the korean won has risen about five pct but in real terms the taiwan dollar has been flat against the u s unit and the won has lost seven pct economists say we ve not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes said bethlehem steel s wendt and so far u s pleas for taiwan and korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect moreover it is uncertain how far u s protectionism will get given the administration s free trade stance it s hard to see that anything will be passed much before year end and then the question is will it have teeth one economist said reuter

2 yeutter sees gatt consensus on farm trade reform u s trade representative clayton yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture delegates from countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest gatt round was launched in punta del este uruguay last september yeutter said at least people seem to be going down the same road but how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely there seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there yeutter said however the hard work is still to come with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead he said it is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy he said he said the long term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas this would help agriculture because some its inefficient non productive segments would stop operating he said individual segments in many countries may lose in the process but it should result in a more rational system of world wide production within or years he said it is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the u s is spending billion dlrs a year and the european community probably more than that which is an ineffective use of financial resources he said asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations he said one has to be politically realistic if there is any chance of getting it agricultural trade reform done in two to three years it s going to have to be as part of a larger package reuter

2 economic spotlight polish sanctions poland says u s sanctions have cost its economy billion dlrs and has made clear it wants washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses some of them are too sophisticated to convert into financial terms one banking source said but western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate they say it is blurred by the poor performance of poland s economy and dismiss the billion dlr figure as illusory sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under achieving they did have a bad effect yes but they only contributed to largely internal economic problems one said the u s imposed the measures and withdrew most favoured nation mfn trading status from poland in in retaliation for suppression of the solidarity free trade union under martial law the estimated cost to the polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the institute of national economy an offshoot of the central planning commission according to one western envoy an expert on polish economic affairs it extrapolated information on growth trends in trade with the united states as well as increases in credits from western commercial and government lenders but the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely he said dismissing the estimate as a theoretical projection based on a high point which has no real scientific evaluation a foreign trade ministry official said polish exports to the u s in the late s averaged around mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed imports have suffered slumping from around mln dlrs to mln as credits ran out poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the west last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted billion official figures show acknowledging that sanctions have lost poland important u s markets including agricultural equipment textiles chemicals and some foodstuffs western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons poland is accusing the west of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons said one expert it s an illusion based on a misunderstanding of western economy there s a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it another said adding that poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the s which were no longer today s reality describing the billion dlr assessment as nebulous one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new mfn status will have little impact on poland which has a hard currency debt of billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry mfn doesn t really mean anything only that poland will not be treated worse than other countries it will be difficult to regain access to the u s market because different forces are in play now said one western envoy he said polish products were not competitive and their quality was too low trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the u s japan and europe would also hamper poland s efforts to regain entry deputy foreign trade minister janusz kaczurba recognised this fact recently kaczurba told the official pap news agency recently making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult and in certain cases impossible in a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about mln dlrs while poland is unlikely to seek compensation it says it has a moral right to assistance from the u s which it says imposed the sanctions illegally but a western economist said the argument that u s sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the polish economy won t cut any ice the americans will just reply that the poles acted immorally in crushing solidarity nevertheless polish national bank head wladyslaw baka in talks in washington last week with the international monetary fund imf and world bank made it clear that poland was looking for a lead from the united states he was quoted by pap as saying that poland would meet its financial obligations to the united states but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners he stressed that the u s had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of poland s partners interested in the settlement of polish debt putting it more sharply one senior banking official blamed washington for obstructing talks with the world bank imf and paris club of western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role as a major superpower the united states can influence international organisations he said citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which western nations were prepared to

4 soviet grains seen entering spring on shaky note soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter weather and crop analysts said prospects for another near record grain harvest in the soviet union appear dim at this point but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems analysts said but the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the soviet grain supply and future buying plans analysts of the soviet union said from a weather standpoint you can say with certainty that the soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop than last year gail martell chief meteorologist for e f hutton said the next six weeks in the ussr s grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops martell and other analysts said where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us an agriculture department authority on the ussr said the soviet union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill this would be equal to about pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years the usda analyst said with a timely spring soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops sometimes as much as pct lower normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures this winter however snowcover in soviet grain areas has generally been excellent so the bulk of winterkill analysts speculate likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination fall dryness may be a problem there s a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness martell said precipitation last fall was as little as pct of normal in southern and northern ukraine and below normal over the entire winter crop area she said recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice crusting and winterkill jim candor senior forecaster for accu weather said livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter analysts said the dry fall damaged pastures the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off pasture feeding they said the soviets are not in a desperate situation they don t have to buy grains now a usda official said but if the soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year s huge crop of mln tonnes was a one time fluke brought on by perfect conditions more soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies he said bad weather during the next six weeks could push the soviets back into the market weather analysts said a lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half martell said reuter

5 opec reaffirms commitment to fixed prices ceiling opec has reaffirmed its commitment to fixed crude oil prices of around dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of mln barrels per day bpd to defend prices its president rilwanu lukman said he told a news conference here after due consultation with my colleagues in opec i hereby wish to emphasize that nigeria and all member countries of opec remain determined to uphold the december agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices lukman added no extraordinary opec conference was planned we are in a position to re confirm that despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary opec member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of february lukman who is nigerian oil minister said lukman put the overall opec output shortfall in february at bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of dlrs agreed upon last december in geneva the december agreement set an overall output ceiling for opec of mln bpd for first half and restored fixed prices as from february around a reference point of dlrs oil prices rallied immediately after the geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that opec was producing more than the agreed level the idea was to suggest that opec s agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of opec oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs lukman said he said the bpd shortfall last february was based on the verified figure for out of opec s members adding that nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of bpd iraq disassociated itself from the december agreement while the production figures of ecuador and the united arab emirates needed to be verified lukman said if that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed we are ready opec is not changing its price level of dlrs the group s president said he said the opec price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to april had been put off indefinitely furthermore no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in december are being adhered to he said asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various opec crudes fixed in relation to the dlr benchmark lukman replied we consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials lukman said opec was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude we don t see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the dlr price throughout the rest of the year lukman said the opec president praised non opec oil producers which he said had contributed to the group s efforts to stabilise prices but he criticised britain for maintaining its long held view not to do anything to help the market we are quite confident however that in the long term with two thirds of the world s reserves in opec hands the future is ours we will use that advantage responsibly he said lukman described the disruption in ecuador s output following an earthquake as tragic but refused to say if the south american country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster reuter

7 after g round one goes to central banks central banks have easily beaten back the foreign exchange market s first test of the industrialized nations recent pact to stabilize currencies analysts said in active trading this week the market pushed the dollar sterling the canadian dollar and australian dollar higher but operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central banks signalled their displeasure so far g has been a roaring success said james o neill financial markets economist at marine midland bank na the central banks are sending strong signals that they won t tolerate any kind of momentum building behind currencies added a senior corporate trader at one u k bank on february the finance ministers and central bank governors of the u s japan west germany france and the u k the group of five plus canada signed an accord under which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around prevailing levels the agreement was viewed by many in the market as an attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable two year decline against major world currencies and initially traders indicated their respect for the accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower but by wednesday the dollar climbed to more than marks about five pfennigs above its levels the friday before the g accord the move was aided by indications that the u s economy picked up steam in february at the same time as the west german economy was regressing but dealers said the federal reserve bank of new york gave traders a sharp reminder that the g pact had encompassed the idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines dealers differed as to whether the u s central bank actually intervened to sell dollars above marks or simply telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading conditions but the dollar quickly backed off it hovered today around marks the market was surprised that the fed showed its face so soon said marine midland na s o neill also on wednesday london dealers said the bank of england intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the u k currency rose to dlrs compared with dlrs before the g pact sterling along with the other high yield currencies like the australian dollar and canadian dollar was in favor after traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant to the paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays on dollar mark and dollar yen the pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving u k economy anticipation of a popular british budget on march and public opinion polls showing good chances for the incumbent conservative party in any general election there was a real run on sterling said anne mills of shearson lehman brothers inc sterling traded today around dlrs down from dlrs last night it slid to marks from yesterday and from a peak of about recently there s been some heavy profit taking on sterling mark ahead of next tuesday s u k

they were stymied the bank of canada acted to slow its currency s rise the canadian dollar traded at per u s dollar today down from yesterday and the australian reserve bank using the fed as agent sold australian dollars in the u s yesterday dealers said the australian dollar fell to a low of u s cents today from a high of thursday analysts said the central banks moves to stifle sudden upward movement leave the market uncertain about its next step today the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a very tight range against the dollar for several months the dollar fell to yen from last night analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long sterling short mark positions established lately because of the change in perceptions about the health of the german economy the funds from those unwinding operations are ending up in yen a dealer at one u k bank said recent west german data have shown falling industry orders lower industrial output and slowing employment gains moreover the yen is benefitting as japanese entities who have invested heavily overseas for example in australian financial instruments repatriate their profits ahead of the end of the japanese fiscal year on march noting that the dollar yen rate is in a sense the most controversial one because of the large u s trade deficit with japan analysts said the stage could be set for another test of the dollar s downward scope against the japanese currency in its latest review of the foreign exchange market through the end of january the federal reserve revealed that it intervened to protect the dollar against the yen on january on that day the dollar fell as low as yen sure the fed bought dollars near the yen level in january but the market has to bear in mind that time marches on and the

5 economic spotlight saudi arabia reshapes economy higher world oil prices coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity could lift saudi arabia s economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits bankers and diplomats said the months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct the first rise since but the economists said this will be possible only if the organisation of petroleum exporting countries opec succeeds in defending world oil prices and if saudi arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long saudi arabia is now keeping production down to defend opec s newly established dlr a barrel benchmark price oil minister hisham nazer told reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day bpd well down on saudi arabia s opec quota of mln set for the first half of king fahd has stamped his personal authority on opec s new found determination to defend prices in a move western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom s need to secure a stable source of income for its economy saudi arabia still the world s largest oil exporter is a hugely wealthy country but the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll economists estimate gross domestic product fell pct last year and pct in oil revenue last year when prices briefly dipped below dlrs per barrel probably totalled no more than billion dlrs compared to a peak billion in austerity is still the watchword but saudi arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession the saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects a diplomat said in the short term the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves still put at around billion dlrs but such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term it also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to tough it out on the oil front even if that means a short term depletion of reserves the budget deficit is targetted at a huge billion riyals or pct of total outlay the budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out commerce minister suleiman abdulaziz al salim told saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year it therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy he said reserves were built up during the late s and early s when saudi arabia s breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary the shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the kingdom s private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom modern techniques of cost control have been introduced markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back the expatriate workforce has fallen sharply the number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but saudi banks hit hard by non performing loans to the corporate sector have become highly selective in extending new credit government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation s industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit as saudi arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad reuter

7 call money pressure from large german banks one or two large west german banks effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits money dealers said as a result call money soared in active trading to around the lombard rate of five pct from pct yesterday as banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily billion marks in interest free minimum reserve assets at the central bank over the first days of the month though this was above the march requirement of billion actual holdings at the weekend were billion to meet the daily average dealers said banks must raise holdings by two billion marks to billion today and tomorrow but liquidity was tight in early business because banks excessively took up the bundesbank s offer for sale of treasury bills on friday this provides a rate of pct for three day deposits and is an effective floor to the market though some liquidity from bills bought on thursday flowed back into the market today the bulk would not return until tomorrow the start of the new month dealers said dealers said the large banks which they did not name commanded short term money requirements of as much as five billion marks or so with a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the month the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills draining liquidity for three days when other banks sought funds rates rose and large banks were able to place excess funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return one senior dealer said the bundesbank with advanced knowledge of the market s needs should have curtailed its sales of treasury bills on friday though dealers only late in the day learn of the total minimum reserve holdings of the previous day the bundesbank has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate the strength of demand for funds the following day he said bundesbank dealers could easily have said we are not selling any treasury bills or we re not selling them in this amount he said if the bundesbank wants to finely steer the market then they should avoid such excesses tomorrow it will be different call money will fall back to pct or so but the bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in rates given the delicate state of currency markets international central banks have been at pains to prevent a dollar fall against major currencies including the mark dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer undertone contributing to downward pressure on the dollar the whole tender policy is to have a call money of between three and four pct in that case the excesses as we have today cannot be very popular the senior dealer said dealers said the large banks probably achieved average rates of return on their excess funds of between pct or four pct this is a higher return than they would have earned without the excessive draining through the treasury bill mechanism because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations between germany s major employers and the unions the bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to monetary policy at its council meeting on thursday they said bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the lombard emergency funding facility to draw down billion marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business reuter

7 economic spotlight ems marks eighth birthday the european monetary system marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in europe economists say but many economists say the system which holds eight european community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands remains in its infancy its new currency the european currency unit ecu has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar and on wednesday the long term vision of the ecu as europe s common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when belgium minted the world s first ecu coin but economists say members such as west germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system s founding fathers ex west german chancellor helmut schmidt and former french president valery giscard d estaing under this phase originally due to have started two years after the ems was set up decision making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous european monetary fund but members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters the basic problem of the ems is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common said one economist who has closely watched the system s development the result is that the ec is often divided over policy on third currencies accentuating what the economists say is the system s greatest weakness its vulnerability to a weak dollar over the past months as the u s dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies the resulting sharp rise of the west german mark severely strained the system more as the mark soared against the dollar it also rose against ems currencies less favoured by international investors and as west germany last year refused to give in pressure from several ec partners and the united states to cut interest rates to slow the mark s rise the ems had to be realigned twice to ease financial and trade strains within the community two months ago the mark and the dutch guilder were revalued by three pct and the belgian and luxembourg francs by two pct against other currencies in the system the french franc italian lira the irish punt and danish crown another frustration has been britain s failure to lend the ems political support by keeping the pound still a major world currency outside the system no change in the british government s attitude is expected before the country s next general elections due by mid meanwhile the system s last realignment the th since it was set up prompted european finance ministers to ask the ec s highly secretive monetary committee and committee of central bank governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in belgium early next month but economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details they are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change technical measures won t be enough to protect the ems against external factors such as dollar weakness for that we must take the step forward to the institutional level said leo de corel of kredietbank s economic research department economists say the system s fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates if the dollar resumes its slide the ems could be in for more turbulence they predict reuter
