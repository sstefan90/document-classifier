2 trade interests ready for battle in u s house u s lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full house of representatives in late april in a move to toughen u s enforcement of trade laws a key house subcommittee last week approved a toned down version of legislation to require president reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices the bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of american industries and turn around last year s record billion dlrs trade deficit generally the bill s provisions toughen u s enforcement of trade laws the trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as dumping products in the united states at prices below cost of production it also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence in writing the bill the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to reagan and said they intend to back amendments to get tough with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out u s products but congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade said the bill ties reagan s hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers bill frenzel r mi said the subcommittee s bill was not one that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work toward a bill reagan and republicans would ultimately endorse the goal of trade legislation was to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements he said in a key concession made at the urging of ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski d il the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices it also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the u s economy rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the house wanted to pass a bill reagan would sign into law reagan last year blocked senate consideration of a tough house trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters late last week that the administration still did not like some of the bill s provisions but he added generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation i think we are progressing very well the first battle will take place next week when the full house ways and means committee considers an amendment by rep richard gephardt d mo to force countries like japan south korea and taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the u s the subcommittee limited the gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the united states will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices but would not automatically set off retaliation organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition afl cio president lane kirkland this year angered the administration when he said any trade bill reagan would sign would not be worth passage in congress but rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by saying i m not trying to write legislation to please lane kirkland i m trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president rep ed jenkins d ga intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry an aide said reagan vetoed a similar measure last year house speaker jim wright of texas one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low priced foreign competition last week renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption reuter

7 leading industrial nations to meet in april leading industrial nations will meet again next month to review their accord on currency stability but u s officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth the narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the normally unruly financial markets and next month s talks seem likely to build on that stability a reagan administration official said the paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm but he said in an interview that financial markets also understood that all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels that is in fact what has happened since paris monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and cease to quarrel over short term policy objectives instead they have focused on medium term policy goals but left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings the official refused to comment however on whether the agreement included a secret pact to consider further coordinated interest rate cuts a measure industrial nations have taken jointly several times in the past year on february the united states japan west germany france britain and canada agreed that major currencies were within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic conditions given commitments by washington to cut its budget deficit and by toyko and bonn to boost economic growth the shake up would strengthen the u s position in future international talks i think these changes will strengthen the president s hand politically and the stronger he is politically the better off we are with the congress and the better off we are in international fora said the official an administration economic policymaker so it would be beneficial to the continued conduct of our initiatives but the official also said the administration would resist calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit a target europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability last week dealers said the federal reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark which had breached to the dollar british authorities are also understood to have intervened to curb sterling s strength international monetary sources say finance ministers and central bankers who will review market performance and their own economic prospects will reassemble again in washington just before the april policymaking meeting of the international monetary fund the sources said italy which refused to join the paris pact was invited back by treasury secretary james baker since paris there are signs west german growth is slowing while u s officials said they were giving japan until april to show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing signs of concern about german prospects emerged recently when bundesbank central bank president karl otto poehl told bankers he would consider cutting west german interest rates if the fed was ready to follow suit a reagan administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in germany but he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the fed and the bundesbank if there is such a provision it is private and if i talked about it it would no longer be private said the official who asked not to be identified public comments by fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged but if the major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the u s trade deficit remains stubbornly high further coordinated action could be on the april agenda reuter

2 nakasone hard pressed to soothe u s anger on trade prime minister yasuhiro nakasone will visit washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting u s anger over japanese trade policies but western diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans nakasone will be hard pressed to come up with anything new to tell u s president ronald reagan and key u s congressmen they said news of the week long visit starting april coincided with news that japan recorded a billion dlr trade surplus last month more than pct higher than a year earlier it also came one day after the reagan administration s economic policy council decided to take retaliatory action against japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint trade agreement on computer microchips nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages one designed to pep up japan s sagging economy and imports in the short term the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over dependence on exports for growth but government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up a package of short term economic measures until after its budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate but his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the u s virtually empty handed nakasone today ordered his ruling liberal democratic party ldp to come up with its own measures he can then tell reagan the ldp package will form the basis of the government s plans without losing face in parliament over the budget political analysts said officials working on the government s short term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations deregulation measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices and accelerated public investment they said a record portion of state investment planned for the entire fiscal year will take place in the first half probably over pct diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy reagan who is under pressure from the democrat controlled u s congress to take greater action to cut the huge american trade deficit to complement the short term measures nakasone is also likely to present reagan with details of japan s longer term economic plans a high ranking advisory body headed by former bank of japan governor haruo maekawa is expected to come up with a final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before nakasone is scheduled to leave for washington its recommendations are designed as a follow up to maekawa s report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy officials said while wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committee s recommendations a subcommittee is considering what the japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring officials said the subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of japan s total output or gross national product around or last year the surplus which measures trade in goods and services amounted to over four pct of gnp the subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual appreciation of the yen to about to the dollar by around from now reuter

4 illinois co op futures dissolution vote set the shareholders of illinois cooperative futures co the futures trading arm of many midwest farm cooperatives for more than years will vote wednesday on its possible dissolution the directors of the company called a special meeting and recommended its dissolution last month citing falling volume and increasing costs sources close to the organization told reuters the pullout of growmark inc which holds more than pct of the capital stock led to the call for dissolution the possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing houses scrambling for the trading business of the regional and local cooperatives that comprise its membership ironically it was growmark at that time a regional farm cooperative with major river terminal elevators that founded illinois cooperative futures on december but growmark became affiliated last year with archer daniels midland of decatur ill and markets its grain through a joint subsidiary of the two companies adm growmark with that relationship growmark no longer needs to trade futures through the cooperative said tom mulligan president of the co op membership in the company which mulligan termed a cooperative of cooperatives has declined from in a notable loss was agriindustries of iowa which became affiliated with cargill inc illinois co op s other members include such regional cooperatives as indiana grain based in indianapolis goldkist of atlanta ga midstates in toledo ohio farmland industries in kansas city mo farmers commodities des moines and harvest states in minneapolis some observors said the demise of illinois cooperative futures co is a serious blow to the cooperative system instead of banding together the individual cooperatives are forced to go their own ways said the floor manager of one cash house at the chicago board of trade such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few major commercial companies are growing dominant he said don hanes vice president for communications with the national council of farm cooperatives said cooperatives exist today down from five years ago the period we ve gone through in the past five years has been quite a crunch he said there s been a lot of consolidation in the marketing co ops one problem he said is the co ops sell the grain to the major commercials for export rather than exporting it themselves losing potential profits but exporting grain requires heavy investments and the multi million dollar loss posted six years ago by farmers export co a co op set up to export grains served to make folks gun shy hanes said mulligan said he believes the dissolution if it is approved is a result of change in the futures industry rather than a change in u s agricultural economics a grain dealer at one member co op said the futures arm was a convenience something that saved us a little bit of money its dissolution will force us to change our way of doing business we re sorry to see the co op go by the wayside he said but there are lot of people out there to do business with there are plenty of capable firms steven w cavanaugh vice president for grain marketing with indiana grain said he would prefer to trade futures through a chicago based cooperative in terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to individuals there would be economic savings he said but added the times change and with changing times come different opinions of what businesses ought to be around cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had nothing to do with its profitability i would guarantee you that this company is not in trouble it is a sound healthy organization in the year ended february the illinois cooperative reported income of mln dlrs and members equity or net worth of mln dlrs the annual report for the most recent year has not been filed under the cooperative system income from operations is returned as patronage refunds to the members income and refunds in the past five years have been declining in the year ended february the co op reported income of mln dlrs and patronage refunds of mln dlrs patronage refunds in the year ended february totalled mln dlrs you re dealing with substantially lower volume mulligan said lower volume translates into higher costs according to the company s annual report growmark owns pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common shares of illinois cooperative futures co mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital growmark is entitled to he said he could not determine the figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution equity is distributed according to each member s trading volume and as a result changes from year to year however mulligan said the company could continue to meet minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if growmark pulled out reuter
